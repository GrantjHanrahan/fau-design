# Challenge

Reproduce a given layout using JavaScript and whatever front end technologies I felt were appropriate.

The solution needed to consider the needs of a wide variety of users, fills in the interactions left out by the designer and appreciates that the template should be easy to update by other developers.

# Approach

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery


# To do

If I had to approach the challenge again;
- I would instead use Sass styling to remove the duplicated css styling rules.
- Research further into the usability needs of potential users and implement the changes into my code.
